# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request 
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ dev ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ dev ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '10.x'
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/npm
      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: test code
        run: npm run test

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: test dev
        run: npm run dev

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
